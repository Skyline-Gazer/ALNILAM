# ALNILAM roadmap (Issue-driven)

**Tracker:** [Skyline-Gazer Project #17](https://github.com/orgs/Skyline-Gazer/projects/17/). Project v2 board status is **not verified** merely because a linked repository Issue exists.

## P0 · Bootstrap & Core/Site
- Initial Monorepo, ADS v0.3 submodule, docs, Astro + Svelte + Tailwind baseline.
- External Site composition, config schema, non-mutation checks, separately reproducible Core/Site inputs.
- CI green, lockfile committed and frozen, content fixtures with upgrades/rollback and path/security tests.
- Complete platform README, developer and user setup, and branch governance.

## P1 · Editorial design
- Brand visual system based on SHBlog Next editorial aesthetics (original implementation).
- Fuwari single-row post list; rich article typography and consistent mobile layout.
- Real dark/light theming, navigation, accessible interactive states and visual regression.
- No unnecessary client JS; reduced-motion and keyboard accessibility.

## P2 · Blogging essentials
- Content schema versioning, archives, tags, categories, Pagefind local search.
- RSS, sitemap, SEO metadata, social preview, i18n and image pipeline.
- Upgrade tests using fixed old Site fixtures, deployment guides for static hosts.

## P3 · Optional advanced features
- Music, gallery/album, moments/dynamics, Bangumi, comments and content enhancements.
- Each feature independently budgeted; disabled features must not ship unused runtime JS.
- License and provenance audits for any code adapted from references.

## P4 · Release readiness
- Deterministic locked CI build, test matrix, security audit, end-to-end mobile desktop checks.
- External Site onboarding example, maintainer docs, changelog and first stable tagged release.
- Native hosting provider deployment only when owner authorizes production cutover.

**Acceptance discipline:** Issue is not closed until linked PR and relevant actual GitHub Actions/browser evidence are recorded. Unavailable GitHub Projects v2 permission must remain explicitly unverified.
